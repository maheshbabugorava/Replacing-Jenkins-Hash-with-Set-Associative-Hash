# Overview
Flow Queue Controlled Delay (FQ-CoDel) is a popular queue discipline to address the problem of bufferbloat. FQ part in FQ-CoDel uses a Jenkins hash function to classify the incoming packets into multiple different queues. However, it suffers from the classic birthday problem. The main aim of this project is to replace Jenkins hash in the Linux implementation of FQ-CoDel, and instead, use set-associative hash.
